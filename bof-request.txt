# Name: Privacy-Preserving Measurement

## Description 

There are many situations in which it is desirable to take
measurements of data which people consider sensitive. For instance,
one might want to measure the most common sites that people browse to
or exposure to some disease. In these cases, the entity taking the
measurement is not interested in people's individual responses but
rather in aggregated data (e.g., how many users visit URL X), but
conventional methods require collecting individual responses and then
aggregating them, thus representing a threat to user privacy and
rendering many such measurements difficult and impractical.

New cryptographic techniques such as Prio and, more recently, a protocol for privacy preserving heavy hitters, address
this gap by splitting up measurements between multiple servers which
can jointly compute the aggregate value without either server learning
the value of individual responses. The Privacy Preserving Measurement
(PPM) work will standardize a protocol for deployment of these
techniques on the Internet. This protocol will include mechanisms for:

* Client submission of individual reports, including proofs of validity.
* Server verification of validity proofs
* Server computation of aggregate values and collection of results to
* Reporting of aggregate results to the entity taking the measurement

This is a WG-forming BOF for a WG to standardize a PPM protocol.  The
PPM WG will not itself define cryptographic algorithms for PPM but
will instead use algorithms defined by the CFRG.
